# FEATURES.md — Operon

Feature implementation tracker. Stable IDs that never renumber.

**When to consult:** When starting a new task (find the ID), when resuming work mid-feature (check status), when planning a sprint (scan the backlog).

**When to update:** When you complete a feature, change its Status cell to ✅ Done. When you start one, change to 🔄 In Progress. Add new IDs for new scope — **never renumber existing IDs**, and never reuse an ID that's been allocated to something else.

## Status Key

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| ✅ Done | Built and working in the codebase |
| 🔄 In Progress | Currently being actively built |
| 🔜 Next | Near-term queue |

## ID Allocation

- **F01–F20** — Phase 1: sale, referrals, EPP, admin panel, webhooks, reconciliation, dashboard pages
- **F21–F40** — Phase 2: emissions, staking, node ops, delegation, uptime, reward claims
- **F41–F60** — Phase 3: TGE, post-TGE commissions in $OPRN, claim portal, secondary market
- **F61+** — Unforeseen

## Phase 1 — Sale & EPP (mostly shipped)

### Sale

| # | Feature | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| F01 | Wallet connect via RainbowKit (Arbitrum + BSC) | ✅ Done | `app/providers.tsx`, `lib/wagmi/config.ts`. MetaMask/WalletConnect/Rabby/Coinbase. |
| F02 | SIWE authentication + JWT issuance | ✅ Done | `app/api/auth/nonce`, `/api/auth/wallet`, `hooks/useAuth.ts`, `lib/auth.ts`. 24h JWT, in-memory token store. |

### Infrastructure (admin + ops surface, built in Phase 1)

| # | Feature | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| I01 | Webhook ingest (Alchemy + QuickNode) with HMAC verification | ✅ Done | `app/api/webhooks/alchemy`, `/quicknode`. |
| I02 | On-chain re-verification (fails closed on RPC timeout) | ✅ Done | `verifyOnChain()` in `lib/webhooks/process-event.ts`. Returns `'ok' \| 'failed' \| 'unreachable'`. |
| I03 | BigInt token amount → USD cents conversion | ✅ Done | `tokenAmountToCents()`. Rejects unknown tokens. |
| I04 | Reconciliation cron (every 5 min, last 100 blocks, `failed_events` retry) | ✅ Done | `app/api/cron/reconcile/route.ts`. Differentiates `pending_verification` vs `process_error`. |
| I05 | Failed-events queue + abandonment alert (Telegram) | ✅ Done | After 5 retries. |
| I06 | Rate limiting (fails closed in production) | ✅ Done | `lib/rate-limit.ts` + Upstash Redis. |
| I07 | Admin endpoint: `sale/pause` + `unpause` (via admin signer) | ✅ Done | `lib/admin-signer.ts`. Env key. Returns 207 on partial chain failure. |
| I08 | Admin endpoint: `events/replay` | ✅ Done | Re-fetch on-chain, re-run idempotent RPC. |
| I09 | Admin endpoint: `events/resolve` | ✅ Done | Manual failed-event resolution with required reason. |
| I10 | Admin endpoint: `partners/tier` (override) | ✅ Done | Allows promotion or demotion with required reason. |
| I11 | Admin endpoint: `payouts/mark-paid` | ✅ Done | Records manual USDC sends. Refuses mixed recipients / already-paid. |
| I12 | Admin endpoint: `epp/invites` (batch generation, CSV) | ✅ Done | Used by `scripts/generate-epp-invites.mjs` too. |
| I13 | Admin allowlist auth (`ADMIN_WALLETS` env) + audit-log-before-mutation | ✅ Done | `lib/admin.ts` `requireAdmin()` + `logAdminAction()`. Allowlist cached. |
| I14 | 6-language i18n (EN, TC, SC, KO, VI, TH) | ✅ Done | `lib/i18n/translations.ts` + EPP-specific `epp-translations.ts`. Thai is real prose; native-speaker pass 2026-04-21 fixed 11 main-file defects + 2 EPP tweaks (see PROGRESS). |
| I15 | NodeSale admin role separation (admin vs Ownable2Step owner) | ✅ Done | `contracts/contracts/NodeSale.sol` — `addReferralCode{s}` / `removeReferralCode` / `setTierActive` moved to `onlyAdmin`; all else stays `onlyOwner`. `setAdmin(address)` rotates the hot key. Makes Gnosis Safe novation (F34) a two-tx handshake instead of a contract redeploy. Tested in "Admin role separation" suite (8 tests). See DECISIONS D26. |
| I16 | Webhook local signed-payload harness | ✅ Done | `scripts/test-webhooks.mjs` — Alchemy + QuickNode, two modes (signature-only / live-tx), `--wrong-sig` negative control.

## Owed Content / Not-a-Feature

These are items owed by the operator (not code work). Tracked here because closing them unblocks Phase 1 launch. Each has a corresponding D-pending entry in DECISIONS.md for context.

- Resources page URLs (9 items) — see D-pending "Resources page content URLs"
- Vercel env vars (`ADMIN_WALLETS`, `ADMIN_PRIVATE_KEY`, rotated `JWT_SECRET`) — D-pending "Vercel deploy env"
- Thai legal review of EPP T&Cs — D-pending "Thai legal review". Note: a native-speaker prose review landed 2026-04-21 (fixed 11 defects in main i18n + 2 EPP tweaks — EPP rated high quality, formal legal register consistent). That is **not** a legal opinion; compliance / MLM classification / securities classification still owed.
- ~~Live testnet smoke test of commission RPC~~ — done via `scripts/smoke-test-commission.mjs` against dev Supabase (commit `5da8d39`)
- ~~Community commission rate table on referrals page (currently stale)~~ — done in commit `5da8d39`: affiliate L5 updated `—` → `1%`, new Community Referral Programme card shows the full 10-3-2-1-1 rate table for non-EPP users
- Delete deprecated `/api/epp/create` route — D-pending "Delete /api/epp/create"
- EPP invite expiry default (currently none) — D-pending "EPP invite expiry policy"

## Update Rule

When you:

- **Complete a feature** → flip its status to ✅ Done. Add a one-line note if the implementation approach needs flagging.
- **Start a feature** → flip to 🔄 In Progress. Only one feature per developer should be in this state at a time.
- **Add new scope** → allocate the next unused ID in the appropriate phase range. Never reuse IDs from the reserved Phase 2/3 slots unless the scope genuinely maps to what the placeholder implied.
- **Delete scope** → leave the ID row in place with a strikethrough and a note `~~F25~~ Removed YYYY-MM-DD: reason`. Don't renumber; don't reuse.
